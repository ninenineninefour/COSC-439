# COSC-439
Projects for my COSC 437 (Computer Networking) class.
Note that the professor required that every file be prefixed with the first letter of my first and last name, hence why they all begin with "el_". I wouldn't ordinarially do this becuase it looks a bit weird.

Project 1: Simple TCP chat program
Project 2: Simple TCP chat program with multiple clients
Project 3: Simple TCP chat program with multiple clients and a basic encryption scheme
Project 4: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
