# COSC-439
Projects for my COSC 437 (Computer Networking) class.

Note that the professor required that every file be prefixed with the first letter of my first and last name, hence why they all begin with "el_". I wouldn't ordinarially do this becuase it looks a bit weird. He also required us to write a readme file that included full instructions on how to compile and run the program. I have no idea why he did that, considering that our project had to run in a specific manner that he specified, so they are all run in the same way, but, well, he's the professor...

Project 1: Simple TCP chat program

Project 2: Simple TCP chat program with multiple clients

Project 3: Simple TCP chat program with multiple clients and a basic encryption scheme

Project 4: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
